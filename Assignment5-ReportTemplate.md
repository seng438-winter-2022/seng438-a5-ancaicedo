# Introduction

# Assessment Using Reliability Growth Testing 

Below are the produced charts for the full failure data series:

## Full data range

### Failure Count

### Failure Intensity

It can be seen from these two graphs that there seems to be a discrepency in the middle of the graph, possible where a change to the program was made. Due to this, we did seperate analysis for the first half and second half of the failure data.
